    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
     const people=person;
     people.number=99;
      console.log(people);
      const people2= Object.assign({},person ,{number:100})
      console.log(people2);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const people3= {...people2};
     const wes={
      name:"wes",
      age:34,
      social:{
        twitter:"@twitter.com",
        facebook:"@facebook.com"
      }
     }
     console.clear();
     const wes1= Object.assign({},wes);
     console.log(wes1);
      wes1.name="mayito";
      console.log(wes1);

      const dev= JSON.parse(JSON.stringfy(wes));

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
